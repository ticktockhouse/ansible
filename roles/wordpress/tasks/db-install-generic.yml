# TODO - do the DB stuff beforehand and take this out as it's mixing DB and web stuff
# Set facts here only, then handoff to another list of tasks to actually do stuff!!!
# TODO - db_user stuff needs to support more options - so we don't end up with same passwords across envs, for instance..

### DB password credstash stuff
- name: Set DB name
  set_fact:
    db_name: "{{ item.slug }}_db"
