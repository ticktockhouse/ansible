# HOW TO ACTIVATE JAILS:

# YOU SHOULD NOT MODIFY THIS FILE.

# It will probably be overwitten or improved in a distribution update.

# The DEFAULT allows a global definition of the options. They can be overridden
# in each jail afterwards.

# "ignoreip" can be an IP address, a CIDR mask or a DNS host. Fail2ban will not
# ban a host which matches an address in this list. Several addresses can be
# defined using space separator.

# "bantime" is the number of seconds that a host is banned.

# A host is banned if it has generated "maxretry" during the last "findtime"

# "usedns" specifies if jails should trust hostnames in logs,
#   warn when DNS lookups are performed, or ignore all hostnames in logs
